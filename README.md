**Research mono-repo for react-native samples**

 Status        | Description
 ------------- | ------------- 
 **STATUS**    | _Under Construction_ 
 **STRATEGY**  | _Spike working example_


## Design

**Replace this with one or more paragraphs explaining the design choices and any reasoning, limitations, trade-offs etc.**  

It should cover at a high-level approach to testing, security concerns, deployment, disaster recovery criticality.  Picture speaks a thousand words.


## Getting started

**Replace this content with instructions to build and run locally or in a DEV environment.**

It should be detailed enough to allow a new engineer joining the team (local or remote) to make reasonable progress with only limited need for assistance from existing engineer.

_If this is a mono-repo with child modules it should contain common and/or specific sections per child project_

### Prerequisites

Replace this with any prerequisites required (e.g. software you need installed or accounts you need access to), with links to WiKi or contacts to help resolve those.

### Building and Testing locally

Replace this with step by step instructions to build and run locally or within a DEV or Docker environment.

### Key Configuration

Replace this with details of where key configuration files are stored in the repository and what purpose they have.  Include a table of anything that is commonly changed between environments that might be helpful for new starter (e.g. main database properties)

Property Name  | Description
 ------------- | ------------- 
 `database`    | e.g. main database url
 `username`    | e.g. username for access to external system    


## Handover Suggestions

_Nuggets of Knowledge and Thinking from last people to work on the project._
_e.g. suggestions for technical debt reduction, simplification or enhancements_

* e.g. use of one transaction for batch load process will not scale, sufficient while < 1000 customers
* e.g. need to revisit the error handling for scenario X
* e.g. potential to upgrade library Y to take advantage of new features which would enable Z
* e.g. could simplify the code by consolidating the three internal services
